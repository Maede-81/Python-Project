## 💡 About the Projects

Many of these projects include **two different solutions** — showing different ways to approach the same problem.  
In each case, **the first solution** represents the **most efficient and reliable approach**, while the second one explores an alternative method or optimization idea.

Each project helped me strengthen different aspects of programming:
- **Logic & Problem Solving:** Games, simulations, and algorithm projects  
- **Data Science & Machine Learning:** Prediction, classification, and NLP tasks  
- **Automation & APIs:** Bots, emailers, and web scraping tools  
- **Web & App Development:** Streamlit dashboards and practical utilities
